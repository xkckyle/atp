In Python, 
load csv file "atp.csv" with columns: Start_Time(format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p'),Batch_ID,Phase,TargetVol_(mL),Volume,Station (format is letter-#),Chemical,Bath.

Set TargetVol_(mL) and Volume to Numeric.
Set Start_Time to datetime and format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p'

Remove all rows where TargetVol_(mL)<3100.
remove rows with Chemical containing "BUFFER"
limit Bath value to be A to D

Derive a summary table called df_limits showing the max of TargetVol_(mL) by Chemical.
Append 2 columns to the summary table:
UCL as TargetVol_(mL)+300
LCL as TargetVol_(mL)-300

Thank you. 
Now with Plotly make_subplots, avoid dash: 
Create line charts with 4 columns and 4 rows, 
set trace color to blue,
X axis is Start_Time, Y axis is Volume,
Bath across columns, Chemical down the rows, each plot has different axis settings, Title is “ATP Dispense - Run Charts”,

overlay a black line TargetVol_(mL) from df_limits, 
red lines for LCL and UCL from the summary table of the same chemical and hide these from the legend,
Hide the Legend, Set the marker size small and increase the chart height,

add yellow lines at 1 standard deviation
auto adjust axis, hide legend.

save as pickle named "atp-new.pkl"
show fig

<!-- Comment out all print lines.
Add a commented line after “df = pd.DataFrame(data)” of “#df = pd.read_csv('atp.csv') “ -->



On the second tab, create box plots of rows by Chemical, with X is Bath sorted and Y is Volume, points="all"

On the third tab, create 4 rows of scatter plots, color by Bath.X axis is Start_Time, Y axis is Volume, add a black line from TargetVol_(mL) from the summary table of the same chemical, use small markers. 
Don’t forget to  plotly.subplots import make_subplots
Replace `import dash_html_components as html` with `from dash import html`
Replace `import dash_core_components as dcc` with `from dash import dcc`

Comment out all print lines.
Add a commented line after “df = pd.DataFrame(data)” of “#df = pd.read_csv('atp.csv'); “

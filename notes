write a python script to do the following:
without pandas, remove columns with blank headers from "peelp.csv"
with pandas load csv file named "peelp.csv" as df
strip the header then replace spaces with '_'

df contains columns named:
Coll_Dt as a date
Matrix_Type as text
Location
Proj_Num
Sealer
Point_A as numeric
Point_B as numeric
Point_C as numeric
Point_D as numeric
Point_E as numeric
Point_F as numeric
Point_Left as numeric
Point_Center as numeric
Point_Right as numeric
please melt all the point columns into a column called Point and a column called Value, 
set Value to numeric
remove rows where Coll_Dt<"01-JAN-24"
remove rows where Value is not numeric
remove rows where Proj_Num is not blank


using plotly and not dash,
create a scatter plot 
with x axis as Coll_Dt
with y axis as Value
